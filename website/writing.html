    <p>Here is where you will find various pieces of writing I have done throughout the year.</p>
    <h2 class="dr">Digital Responsibility Research Essay (Introduction)</h2>
    <p>CART administration and teachers should implement a CART-wide curriculum that teaches CART students how to keep their personal, digital information secure and the importance of such security. Many students do not understand the importance of online security. Internet security is a broad term for  transactions made over the internet to ensure browser security, to keep data entered online safe, and to make sure your internet data says authentic and protected (What Is Internet Security?) . The advances technology has taken in the past ten years have opened the internet, therefore social media, to teenagers like never before.</p>
    <h2 class="sma">Social Media Awareness Flyer</h2>
    <p>Many companies will google anyone applying to work for them. In someone’s google search of your name, they can find your digital footprint, which includes: social media accounts, public records and any other online activity. 70% of candidates do not get hired because of information found online. It’s important to know what your future employers may find about you.</p>
    <h2 class="rpo">Ready Player One Essay</h2>
    <p>Ready Player One should be read in schools because it teaches students to keep pursuing their goals and to never give up. During the story Wade Watts is desperately trying to find the hidden Easter Egg, but stumbles into tons of obstacles. For example, the sixers blow up his house (page 145) and instead of wallowing and feeling sad for himself he gets up and fights back. When working his way around and through these obstacles, they make him mentally and physically tougher. We can take a lesson from Wade Watts in if you want something, you need to work for it because no one is going to hand it to you.</p>
