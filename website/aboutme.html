<body>
    <p>My name is Nathaniel Lund and I am looking for internships and/or employment in game development. I am proficient in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also have experience using Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office.
</p>
<p>I am enrolled at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) in Clovis, California where I take the Web Applications and Design Lab. During my time in this lab, I have learned invaluable skills in programming and teamwork due to our multifold of group projects. I have also been practicing speech and presentation skills constantly as a result of our frequent class presentations.
</p>
<p>During my spare time I play with my dog and take her on walks, spend time with my family and friends or play video games. I have taken on a huge responsibility in owning a dog, but from my experience I have learned that the most rewarding things are the ones you work hard for. The first video game I remember playing was Contra when I was 5. Since then I have been playing an ample amount of video games and I believe my experience in video games is great to have for a game developer because I understand what makes a good game and I am connected to several different gaming communities.
